# BBOX-style-case-for-Warpstone


This is a top mount style case for DrHigsby's Warpstone
https://github.com/drhigsby/warpstone

It is meant for use with FDM printing. I printed it face down on the build plate with no brims and no supports to preserve the details of the bevel cuts, but it works okay with a brim as well. Supports will fill in the cuts on the sides that are similar to the bbox style case. The pcb is top mounted to the top case with m2 screws directly into the plastic, and then the bottom piece of the case attaches with m2 screws into heatset inserts in the top case. I may update the design to mount the pcb to the top with heatset inserts as well at some point.

the weight is currently in progress and will likely have space for either a battery compartment for N!N or space for something like wheel weights.
