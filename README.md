# BBOX-style-case-for-Warpstone


This is a top mount style case for DrHigsby's Warpstone. It is tested with FDM printing, but not with anything else so I don't know how it will work. I printed it face down on the build plate with no brims and no supports to preserve the details of the bevel cuts, but it works okay with a brim as well. Supports will fill in the cuts on the sides that are similar to the bbox style case. 

the weight is currently in progress and will likely have space for either a battery compartment for N!N or space for something like wheel weights.
